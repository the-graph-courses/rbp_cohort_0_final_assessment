# **Summary**

For the final assessment, you will use Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) data to create Rmarkdown-based reports on a specific country and a specific topic.

The report should:

-   Be based on one of the DHS women's recode survey datasets compiled [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1J0gw4qpfbB8bYFbXx8QcsQEWgJSVwp_P){target="_blank"};

-   Be at least 300 words in length; and

-   Include at least four ggplot2-based figures

To submit, you should

-   upload a zip folder with two files---your Rmarkdown and your knitted HTML file---to the assignment page.

-   record a short video (5 to 15 minutes) where you talk through your Rmd document and its output. (This is not graded, it is just a way to verify that you are the actual author of your work.). Put a link to this video in the comments section of the assignment page. (If you're not sure how to record, see the FAQs at the bottom of this document.)

The deadline for submission is Jan 31st 2022 at 23:59 UTC+2. Late work will be penalized.

Those are the instructions in a nutshell. The rest of this document is a guide to help you excel at this task, but if you feel ready to proceed with just the instructions above, you can charge ahead--no need to read further!

## Example report

To help give you a clear sense of what is expected of you, we have created an example report, which you can access by downloading the zip folder [here](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/the-graph-courses/rbp_cohort_0_materials/tree/main/final_assignment_example){target="_blank"}.

This report is based on the Nigerian 2018 DHS survey. You can download this data [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1c-MIFYKZ0eT9DbSek8rpNgyXAGElW6j4/view?usp=share_link){target="_blank"} if you want to replicate the analysis as a way to practice.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# **Prelude: systematic vs just-in-time learning**

As you work on this assessment, you will encounter several functions and concepts that you have not previously learned. You'll therefore be required to pick these up "on the go" as you move through the analysis. This type of just-in-time learning, where you acquire knowledge exactly at the point when you need it, is different from the systematic, front-loaded learning approach that we have used throughout the course thus far, where all relevant information was presented before it was applied or tested.

Just-in-time learning will require you to be proactive in seeking out resources and asking for help when needed. It may be challenging at times, but it is a valuable skill to have as a programmer and will serve you well in your future career.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now let's see what are the recommended sequences of steps for working on the assessment.

# **Step 1: Understand the DHS**

Before beginning your analysis, it is important to understand the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) and the data that you will be using.

The Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) are a series of standardized surveys conducted in developing countries that collect data on various aspects of population, health, and nutrition.

These surveys, which are funded by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), provide policymakers with accurate and reliable data to inform decision-making and improve public health outcomes.

The *individual (women's) recode* files contain individual-level data on women aged 15 to 49 in the surveyed households. This data will be the source for your reports.

You can learn more about the DHS program and the various surveys they run by watching the following video:

```{r echo = F}

```

Pay particular attention to the section from 2:33 to 3:20, as it provides information on the specific survey type whose data you will be using.

# **Step 2: Choose a report topic**

Now that you have a general understanding of the DHS surveys and the data that is collected, it's time to choose a topic for your report. This will determine the focus of your analysis and the specific statistics you will be presenting.

To help guide your selection, you should look through past "Key Findings/Summary Reports" that certain DHS-participating countries have published. These reports highlight important findings and patterns from the surveys and should serve as inspiration for your own analysis. Links to a few examples can be found below:

-   [Nigeria 2018](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10pp9O9EJZvideynYyANqJtBCsN_vNQjs/view?usp=sharing){target="_blank"}

-   [Madagascar 2021 (French)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UYysl3VcY9mFb_r7X__Uaue1LhnY2j0k/view?usp=sharing){target="_blank"}

-   [Jordan 2017-18](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-7snwWkSdD4leDj6D1Wf6o93qqX4pbo-/view?usp=sharing){target="_blank"}

And you can peruse all the available reports [**here**](https://dhsprogram.com/search/index.cfm?_srchd=1&bydoctype=publication&bypubtype=10){target="_blank"}:

Some potential topics to consider include family planning, gender, maternity, alcohol and tobacco, fertility, HIV, tuberculosis, youth, disability, women's empowerment and domestic violence.

Note that you should choose a topic and set of statistics that focus on the women who were surveyed, rather than their children or men. If you want to calculate statistics about men, you will need to request a different data file, known as the men's recode, which includes men's answers to the surveys. Calculating statistics about children (e.g. % of children with anaemia) will also be challenging. To do so, you would need to reshape (pivot) the women's dataset, since each woman has multiple children. While you have learned how to pivot, this particular instance may prove quite challenging, so we recommend avoiding it.

# **Step 3: Obtain the women's recode file for a specific country**

To conduct your analysis, you will need access to the individual (women's) recode files for a specific country's DHS survey. All DHS data can be obtained directly from the DHS website by [registering](https://dhsprogram.com/data/new-user-registration.cfm){target="_blank"} for an account and then requesting the datasets.

But to speed you up, we have requested and compiled the latest survey data for any countries surveyed since 2003. You should select a survey to analyze from this collection. To access these files, follow this Google Drive [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1J0gw4qpfbB8bYFbXx8QcsQEWgJSVwp_P?usp=share_link){target="_blank"}. From this folder, choose the zip file for the country you are interested in and download that to your computer.

You may be a bit puzzled by the DHS file names you see. These names follow a specific convention, with the Country Code (e.g. CM for Cameroon), Dataset Type (e.g. IR for the women's dataset), Dataset Version (indicated by the first and second characters, representing the DHS Phase and Release version, respectively), and File Format (e.g. DT-Stata, SD-SAS) all included. For your convenience, we have renamed the zip files using the full country names rather than the country codes.

One part of the name you should pay attention is the number immediately after "IR" in the file names, which indicates the DHS survey phase. For example, if the file name is "Cameroon_IR71DT", the number 7 indicates that this is DHS survey phase 7. The survey phase gives you a sense of when the survey was carried out. You can see the phase timeline [here](https://dhsprogram.com/data/Guide-to-DHS-Statistics/Description_of_The_Demographic_and_Health_Surveys_Program.htm){target="_blank"}.

The rest of the file name nomenclature is not particularly important for this analysis, but you can learn more about it in this video:

```{r echo = F}
embed_url("https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puCCqGU71uM")
```

Once you have downloaded and unzipped the folder, you will see that it contains several different file types:

![](images/dhs_file_types.jpg){width="500"}

Most of these files are superfluous to your need. The two files that you will need for this analysis are the .DTA file (the main data file in STATA format) and the .MAP file (the data dictionary).

Create a new RStudio project for your analysis and place these two files in the "data" subfolder of your project.

# **Step 4: Import your dataset**

To import the DHS dataset from the .DTA format into R, you will use the `read_dta()` function from the {haven} package.

Because DHS files can be quite large, it is recommended that you do not import the entire dataset at once, as this may take unreasonably long to run. Instead, you should use one of two arguments to select a subset of the data to import: `n_max` and `col_select`.

The `n_max` argument allows you to specify the number of rows to import. For example:

```{r eval = F}
ir_raw <- haven::read_dta(here("data/NGIR7BFL.DTA"),
                          n_max = 300)
```

This will only import the first 300 rows.

The col_select argument allows you to select specific columns to import, either by name or by position. For example:

```{r eval = F}
# select by position
ir_raw <- haven::read_dta(here("data/NGIR7BFL.DTA"),
                          col_select = 1:3)

# select by name
ir_raw <- haven::read_dta(here("data/NGIR7BDT/NGIR7BFL.DTA"),
                           c(caseid, v000, v001))
```

You will probably want to start your analysis by first importing **all columns but just a few rows** (maybe 100 rows, with `n_max = 100`). Then, when you have decided which are the columns of interest, you can import all *rows* but just those columns you have selected. That way, you avoid ever needing to import all rows AND all columns, which would probably overwhelm your computer.

Another note on importing data: the `read_dta()` function reads in factor data as a special data type called **labelled** data. This type is unfamiliar to you and can be problematic for later analysis, so we recommend converting these to regular R factors using the function `haven::as_factor()`.

For example:

```{r eval = F}
ir_converted <- 
  ir_raw %>%
  haven::as_factor() # pass the whole data frame as_factor()
```

# **Step 5: Identify and analyze the relevant variables**

You now have the data you need, and from looking at official reports from DHS, you have a sense of the topic you would like to present.

Your next step is to figure out which of the DHS variables is relevant for the analyses you are conducting. This is not a simple task, since the DHS variable names are not very descriptive (example variable names are v000 and v001), and there are several *thousand* available variables.

To find variables relevant to your chosen topic, you can use two key resources.

1.  The first is the .MAP file we talked about earlier. If you open the .MAP file for your downloaded survey (with TextEdit or Notepad) you'll see that it is a data dictionary with a definition for each variable. Here are a few lines from one such .MAP file:

    CASEID (id) Case Identification\
    V000 Country code and phase\
    V001 Cluster number\
    V002 Household number\
    V003 Respondent's line number

    So, if you are working on a topic like HIV, you can simply search the MAP file for the word "HIV", and you will be lead to the HIV-relevant variables. Sometimes the variable description you will see in the MAP files is not detailed enough. In that case, you can search for the variable name in the DHS recode manuals, which you can find on [this page](https://dhsprogram.com/publications/publication-dhsg4-dhs-questionnaires-and-manuals.cfm){target="_blank"}. The recode manuals are similar to the MAP files, but they explain each variable in a bit more detail.

2.  Secondly, the DHS has created a wonderful online resource called "Guide to DHS statistics", viewable [here](https://dhsprogram.com/data/Guide-to-DHS-Statistics){target="_blank"}. If you are studying a topic like HIV, you can simply go to HIV section, click on a specific subtopic, e.g. "Prior HIV testing" and you will see a list of variables that are relevant to that statistic.

# **Step 6: Read the rubric**

As you work on your analysis, you should keep in mind the rubric against which your work will be graded. Your report will be assessed along the following five dimensions:

1.  Data wrangling (30%)

2.  Quality of figures (30%)

3.  Communication of insights (15%)

4.  Use of Rmarkdown (15%)

5.  Syntax and code formatting (10%)

Each component is outlined in more detail below.

## **Data wrangling**

To get full credit in this category, you will need to demonstrate that you have used appropriate data wrangling techniques to prepare the data for analysis. This includes cleaning and organizing the data, selecting relevant variables, and grouping and summarizing the data as needed.

## **Quality of figures**

To get full credit in this category, you will need to create at least four ggplot-based figures that are clear, informative, and aesthetically pleasing. You should also make sure to include appropriate titles and labels for your figures.

## **Communication of insights**

To get full credit in this category, you will need to clearly and concisely communicate your findings and insights from the data analysis. This includes writing clear, concise, and well-organized text, as well as effectively using the figures you have created to support your insights.

## **Use of Rmarkdown**

To get full credit in this category, you will need to demonstrate that you have effectively used Rmarkdown to create a professional-looking document. This includes using appropriate formatting, including headings and lists, and using Rmarkdown features such as code chunks and inline code.

## **Syntax and code formatting**

To get full credit in this category, you will need to demonstrate that you have used clean, well-organized code that is easy to read and understand. This includes using appropriate indentation, commenting your code, and using clear, descriptive variable names.

# **Step 7: Submit your work**

As mentioned above, to submit your work you should

-   Knit your Rmd to an HTML format

-   Zip the Rmd and HTML into a single folder, and upload to the assignment page.

-   Record a 5-15 minute walkthrough of your Rmd and HTML output, and leave a link to this as a comment on the assignment page.

# **FAQs**

**My percentages and numbers differ slightly with those seen in the official DHS publications. What is going on?**

Due to the sampling design of the DHS, respondent data should be weighted when conducting analyses. But we have not yet taught you how to do this, and do not expect you to take into account the respondent weights. So your numbers will differ slightly from the official numbers. This is okay!

**This sounds like a lot of work. Why should I try to do a good job at this?**

First, your score on the final assessment will compose 40% of your final grade. Doing a very poor job here may jeopardize your ability to earn a certificate for the course (the pass mark for the course is 70%).

Secondly, this is a valuable opportunity to reinforce your knowledge, and bring together many of the things you have learned over the course.

Finally, depending on how much effort you put into it, the report you create could be a great way to showcase your abilities to potential employers or academic institutions in the future, especially after you have received and acted on the feedback you'll receive from our instructors.

**Must the report be in English?**

You are allowed to write the report in English, French or Spanish.

**How should I record a video?**

If you have never done a screen recording before, we recommend Loom.com. It allows you to quickly record your screen AND share that recording immediately. So there is no need to upload to Youtube, Vimeo, or some other such service.

**What should I include in my video presentation?**

In your video presentation, you should walk through your Rmd document, explaining your code, analysis and some findings. As a reminder, this video presentation is not graded. We ask for it as a way to verify that you are the author of the work submitted.

**Can I use data from a different survey than the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS)?**

Yes, but you will first need to obtain permission from one of our instructors.

**Can I use a different data visualization package other than ggplot?**

Yes; other options include plotly, highcharter. Get permission from an instructor before proceeding with this though.

**Can I create a dashboard instead?**

Yes. Any HTML document which can be published to rpubs, including flexdashboards, will be a valid submission.
